# IoT-Integrated-Health-Monitoring-System-Featuring-Fall-Detection-and-Environmental-Sensing

This project aims to develop a comprehensive, IoT-based health monitoring system that can:
• Monitor vital physiological indicators like body temperature, heart rate, SpO₂, and ECG
readings continuously.
• Use motion sensors to identify falls so that prompt action can be taken.
• Keep an eye on environmental factors like air quality, humidity, and room temperature.
• ESP32 enables real-time data transfer to a cloud interface, enabling remote monitoring and
access.
• Set off notifications or warnings in the event of emergency or unusual readings.
This system promotes safer and more independent living, especially for the elderly and those
with chronic illnesses, by combining environmental awareness, fall detection, and health
sensing into a single platform.

The goal of this system is to provide real-time monitoring of physiological and environmental
data via an IoT-based solution that is compact, inexpensive, and simple to use. The device,
which may be used at home or in assisted living facilities, aids in the early detection of
potential health issues, improves patient safety, and decreases the strain on carers.
